So i understand functions and i understand how to grab elements in the dom but manipulation is confusing 
when to use what and how to know what selector to use 

study events in javascript

javascript can only process on object at a time so you cannot just grab all objects and color 
them you have to put a loop or else the cache is full 

ex 
<p>duh</p>
<p>duh</p>
<p>duh</p>

if you say document.querySelector("p").style.backgroundColor = "red";
 the query called all of the p element into memory and picks the first one
but you say document.querySelectorAll("p").style.backgroundColor = "red";
 the javascript is confused because you never told it what to do with the first one in memory

make a variable and set the variable equal to the name of the element clicked
listen for event 
set the toggle for the variable true if click else keep listening

let Bc = eventlistiner()clicked
eventlistenter
if eventlistner clicked is true set Bc class to done 
      or you could say 
if clicked set the class of the element clicked to done
