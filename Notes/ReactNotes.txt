react notes 
destructering
data flow 
use i as index instead of using numbers for counting
keep going be a developer
use .map to loop and remember to add key otherwise when you delete a item out of the array
otherwise react will not know which object to delete and have to re-render the whole page without the object that you deleted
pure fuctions receive one input and always return one output
 
in order to do data flow in react you have to tell it to do something and to show something do this = constructor() and show this = render()
pass the do this into the place where you want to render it 
 
super() make javascript read with priority and allows you to read outside the current scope 

yous .children to wrap capital letters in react
