// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.
prompt(firstNumber)
var = firstNumber
prompt(secondNumber)
var = secondNumber
firstnumber + second number
alert SUM 



the prompt is a sting hence the () so the text inside should be reprsented as such 
close the code ;
alert individually

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
