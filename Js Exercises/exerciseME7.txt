// Create an object and an array which we will use in our facebook exercise. 

// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.
var user = {
    username: "matt",
    password: "123letmein"
};

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".
 var database = ["user"];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".
var newfeed = [{username:"",
                timeline:""
               },
               {username:"",
                timeline:""
               },
               {username:"",
                timeline:""
               },
             ];
 // best code practices would be to put the write like this 
var newfeed = [
  {		
	username:"",
        timeline:""
  },
  {		
	username:"",
        timeline:""
  },
  {		
	username:"",
        timeline:""
  },
];
